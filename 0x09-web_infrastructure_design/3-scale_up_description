Server (Physical or Virtual Machine):

Acts as the foundation of the infrastructure, hosting various components of the web application.
Provides computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) for running the services.
Load Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability.
Improves fault tolerance by evenly distributing the load and redirecting traffic away from unhealthy servers.
Web Server (e.g., Nginx or Apache):

Handles HTTP requests from clients and serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and images.
Offloads the application server by serving static files directly to clients, improving overall performance and scalability.
Application Server:

Executes the application logic and processes dynamic content requests.
Runs the server-side code responsible for generating dynamic web pages, handling user authentication, and interacting with the database.
Database Server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL):

Stores and manages structured data required by the web application.
Provides a reliable and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Explanation:
Load Balancer:

Added to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers in a cluster to ensure high availability and scalability.
Prevents overload on individual servers by evenly distributing the load and redirecting traffic away from unhealthy or overloaded servers.
Enhances fault tolerance and resilience by automatically detecting and routing around failed servers, minimizing downtime and service interruptions.
Web Server:

Separated from the application server to optimize resource utilization and improve performance.
Handles static content delivery efficiently, freeing up resources on the application server to focus on processing dynamic content and application logic.
Allows for easier scaling as static content can be served directly from the web server without impacting the application server's workload.
Application Server:

Dedicated to executing the application logic and handling dynamic content generation.
Isolated from the web server to prevent resource contention and ensure efficient processing of dynamic requests.
Enables scaling of the application tier independently from the web server tier, allowing for better resource allocation and performance optimization.
Database Server:

Separated from the application and web servers to improve security, scalability, and performance.
Provides a centralized and reliable data storage solution for the web application, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Allows for efficient management of database resources and optimization of database performance without impacting other server components.
